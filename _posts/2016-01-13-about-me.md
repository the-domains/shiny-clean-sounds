I am an Avid
Certified Instructor in Pro Tools and an proud member of Post New York Alliance,
highly proficient in recording and editing techniques of voiceover, ADR, and
Foley, and well-versed in methods of sound design and mixing for film and
television standards. A comprehensive list of film credits is available on IMDB.

I received
a Bachelor's Degree from Manhattanville College where I studied music
composition, performance, and business, having performed in several groups, and
continue to compose and perform solo.

Additionally,
as an adjunct professor for the multinational SAE schools, New York campus, I
instruct students on the technical and experiential approaches to sound editing
and design for film, television, and video games.

If you have
any questions concerning my availability, or if there's some way my services
could benefit your project, please let me know how I can be of help.
